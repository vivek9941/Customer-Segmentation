# Customer-Segmentation

**“When you try to serve everyone, you serve no-one.”**

Many companies try to sell their products or services without having any idea about its target audience. This motivated us to choose Customer Segmentation as our project topic for the course DS303 (Introduction to Machine Learning). Customer segmentation is basically dividing the market into discrete customer groups that have similar characteristics. This division helps companies identify customer needs, market opportunity and, target audience for themselves thereby driving up the revenues and outperforming competition. We use KMeans Algorithm in this project to cluster various customer having similar characteristics.
